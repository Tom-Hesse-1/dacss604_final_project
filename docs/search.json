    "text": "[Topic Sentence Here]. To even casual observers, polarization and division seem to characterize American politics. Bitter political cleavages have been formed along the lines of several factors: political ideologies (Source), age groups (Source), racial/ethnic identities (Source), and more. One divide stands out as particularly stark: geography. Rural and Urban politics are particularly polarized. Americans living in different types of geographic settings have opposing ideas on political issues (Source). Give examples polarization.\nParagraph about geographic polarization/division in general. Cite studies of issue in Italy, France.\nPolitical division has wide-reaching negative effects on both individuals and groups (Sources). Give examples of such negative effects. Predictions have been made that such polarization may deepen in coming years. This division and polarization is established and worrisome, but much of the research examines politics at the national level: what about politics at the state level? This project contributes to the investigation of this question."

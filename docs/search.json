    "text": "[Topic Sentence Here]. To even casual observers, polarization and division seem to characterize American politics. Bitter political cleavages have been formed along the lines of several factors: political ideologies (Deane & Gramlich, 2020), age groups (Pew Research Center, 2018), racial/ethnic identities (Silver et al., 2021), and more. One divide stands out as particularly stark: geography. Rural and Urban politics are particularly polarized. Americans living in different types of geographic settings have opposing ideas on political issues (Mettler & Brown, 2022; Savat, 2020, Gimpel et al., 2020).\nGeography can have strong associations with political ideologies. Scholars have identified a cleavage in political opinions of rural- and urban-dwelling Americans in recent years (Mettler & Brown, 2022; Savat, 2020). Rural voters strongly support Republican candidates (Gimpel et al., 2020), support greater restriction of the press (Mettler & Brown, 2022), and tend to be more resistant to new ideas in governance (Savat, 2020). Similar cleavages have been observed in other countries. Pairigi & Sartori (2014) found a similar cleavage based on geography in Italian national politics in the 1970s. Furthermore, Brookes & Cappellina have found evidence of a rural-urban divide in French politics in recent years. Significant evidence shows that geography can be a powerful force in politics, with the potential to cause harmful division.\nPolitical division has wide-reaching negative effects, such as increased hostilities between factions and extremist beliefs. (Mettler & Brown, 2022). Predictions have been made that such polarization may deepen in coming years (Heltzel & Laurin, 2020). This division and polarization is established and worrisome, but much of the research examines US politics at the national level: what about politics at the state level? This project contributes to the investigation of this question."

    "text": "Network Analysis of Massachusetts House of Representatives, 2021–2022\nThe quantitative portion of the project examines political cooperation in Massachusetts’ House of Representatives during the 192nd General Court (the name of Massachusetts’ legislature). This legislative body was in session throughout 2021 and 2022. The primary method of investigation was network analysis of this body. Brief Primer on network theory/analysis.\nIn this project, nodes represent individual representatives (legislators) in the 192nd General Court, and edges represent the cosponsoring of a bill. For example, if Representative A and Representative B both sponsor bill X, then there would be an edge between those two representatives. In this project, edges are weighted. If edges are weighted, it means that they have a value associated with them, representing some measurement. In this project, edge weight represents how many bills two nodes cosponsored. For instance, in the previous scenario, Representative A and Representative B cosponsored one bill, therefore the weight of the edge connecting them would be one. In another example, Representative B and Representative C sponsored three of the same bills, therefore the weight of the edge between them would be three. The data consisted of 87 nodes (individual representatives) and 50 bills that formed edges (connections) between those representatives. All bills were introduced during the 192nd General Court.\nThis analysis yielded multiple insights into the nature of political cooperation in the Massachusetts legislature. The graph below (Figure 1) shows the 10 nodes with the highest degree. In this case, a node’s degree is equal to the sum of the weights of all it’s different edges. For example, if Node A has 3 edges, all with weights of 2, then Node A has a degree of 6. Examining the nodes with the highest degrees is useful because it shows us which nodes are the most connected to other nodes in the network, i.e., which representatives are the most collaborative in this sample. Edges’ weights are denoted by their thickness: the thicker a connection between two nodes, the more bills those two nodes cosponsored together.\nWith the shape of the nodes representing geographic-setting-type (circle = rural district, square = urban district), we can see that the most collaborative representatives consist of a heterogeneous mix of urban-representing and rural-representing legislators. 6 of these nodes represent urban districts, 4 represent rural districts, and each of these nodes are heavily connected to one another. This paints a picture of rural- and urban-representing legislators collaborating by sponsoring the same bills, denoting a lack of division and polarization.\nFigure 1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can learn more from this network. Another aspect of network theory, Block Modeling, can provide more insights about the nature of political collaboration in the Massachusetts legislature. Blockmodeling is a method used to simplify and study complex networks. It works by grouping nodes that have similar patterns of edges together, forming “blocks.” Therefore, nodes that are grouped together have similar roles within the networks. By analyzing which blocks different representatives are grouped into, we can learn about patterns of collaboration within this network.\nThe table below (Figure 2) shows a table that summarizes important information yielded by the blockmodeling analysis done for this project. In this case, the network was divided into 10 blocks. Each row in the table represents a distinct block. The different columns show how many rural-district-representing, urban-district-representing, Democrat, and Republican legislators are in each block. It also shows the ratios of rural:urban representatives and Democrat:Republican representatives in each group.\nFigure 2:\n\n\n\nBlockmodel Group Statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nRural\nUrban\nDemocrat\nRepublican\nRural:Urban_Ratio\nDemocrat:Republican_Ratio\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n5\n4\n6\n1.00\n0.67\n\n\n2\n0\n12\n12\n0\n0.00\nInf\n\n\n3\n5\n2\n0\n7\n2.50\n0.00\n\n\n4\n11\n12\n21\n1\n0.92\n21.00\n\n\n5\n1\n3\n3\n1\n0.33\n3.00\n\n\n6\n1\n6\n7\n0\n0.17\nInf\n\n\n7\n1\n16\n17\n0\n0.06\nInf\n\n\n8\n2\n1\n3\n0\n2.00\nInf\n\n\n9\n1\n0\n1\n0\nInf\nInf\n\n\n10\n1\n2\n3\n0\n0.50\nInf\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that some groups show a diverse collection of rural and urban representatives (e.g. groups 1, 3, and 4), while others skew more heavily rural or urban (e.g. groups 2, 6, and 7). This shows that in some sections of the legislature, there is high collaboration between legislators representing different geographic types. In other factions, collaboration is more common between legislators that represent the same type of district. This adds nuance to our understanding of the network. We can see that there is certainly a significant level of collaboration between rural and urban representatives—confirming what Figure 1 shows us—but there are also portions of the legislature where such collaboration is less common.\nWhat does this tell us? It tells us that there was a moderate amount of rural-urban collaboration throughout Massachusetts 192nd House of Representatives, however it was concentrated in certain groups of legislators, while other groups displayed less inter-group collaboration. To make an analogy, picture a high-school cafeteria: some portion of the students are upperclassmen, the rest are lowerclassmen. A significant number of the tables in the cafeteria have both upperclassmen and lowerclassmen sitting at them, showing considerable mingling between the two groups. At the same time, there is also a significant number of tables that have mostly (or all) upperclassmen or lowerclassmen. In this cafeteria, inter-group mingling is common, but groups keeping to themselves is also common."

This legislative body was in session throughout 2021 and 2022. The primary method of investigation was a network analysis of this body. Network analysis is a tool in Network Theory. Network theory is a branch of the social sciences that examines how entities within a group (i.e. network) are connected to each other. Within these networks, entities are represented by “nodes”, and are connected by “edges.” Nodes can represent many things, such as individual people, governments, social groups, etc. Edges can similarly take many different forms. Edges can represent shared beliefs, conversations between individuals, banking transactions, etc. The specifics vary from project to project, but the essence of network analysis is the study of groups (networks) and their interactions and structures.\nIn this project, nodes represent individual representatives (legislators) in the 192nd General Court, and edges represent the cosponsoring of a bill. For example, if Representative A and Representative B both sponsor bill X, then there would be an edge between those two representatives. In this project, edges are weighted.

The graph below (Figure 1) shows the 10 nodes with the highest degree. In this case, a node’s degree is equal to the sum of the weights of all its different edges. For example, if Node A has 3 edges connecting it to different nodes, with all edges having weights of 2, then Node A has a degree of 6 (2*3=6). Examining the nodes with the highest degrees is useful because it shows us which nodes are the most connected to other nodes in the network, i.e., which representatives are the most collaborative in this sample. In Figure 1, Edges’ weights are denoted by their thickness: the thicker a connection (line) between two nodes, the more bills those two nodes cosponsored together.\nWith the shape of the nodes representing geographic-setting-type (circle = rural representative, square = urban representative), we can see that the most collaborative representatives consist of a heterogeneous mix of urban-representing and rural-representing legislators. 6 of these nodes represent urban representatives, 4 represent rural representatives, and each of these nodes are heavily connected to one another. This paints a picture of rural and urban legislators collaborating by sponsoring the same bills, denoting a lack of division and polarization among these important and productive legislators.\n\nFigure 1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlockmodeling the Network\nWe can learn more from this network.

However, they do not convey the humanity behind the numbers. For greater depth of understanding, we turn to qualitative methods."

    "text": "Qualitative: Interview and Observation of Massachusetts Senate, 2023–2024\nThe qualitative portion of this project examines political cooperation in Massachusetts’ Senate during the 193rd General Court, which was in session throughout 2023 and 2024. The primary methods included in this portion of the project were an interview with a political insider—a senior member of a Massachusetts State Senator’s staff—and ethnographic observation of legislative sessions. This portion of the project focused on adding depth of understanding to the patterns observed in the quantitative portion. The interview and observation sessions gave deeper insight into what political cooperation in Massachusetts state politics looks like.\nUnlike the quantitative portion of the project, this portion did not focus on finding broad patterns, rather it was designed to evoke depth and nuance that complement the patterns found in the quantitative portion. These qualitative methods provided rich details about attitudes and experiences of legislators and political insiders in the Massachusetts General Court. The semi-structured interview with a political insider yielded candid information that would be nearly impossible to find within quantitative data, and the ethnographic observation revealed what the nature of political collaboration in Massachusetts’ legislature looks like in action. Both methods are detailed below.\n\nThe Interview\nIn August 2024, I interviewed a senior staff member (“The Staffer”) of a then-sitting Massachusetts State Senator (“The Senator”). The Staffer was then responsible for assisting The Senator with much of their legislative work. The Staffer had candid exposure to most of The Senator’s dealings, and therefore had privileged access to political operations within the Massachusetts State Senate. Both The Staffer’s and The Senator’s identities are kept secret for the purposes of confidentiality.\nThe interview was semi-structured, meaning that there was a loose written script with specific questions and general ideas to explore, but I was free to go off-script and improvise questions and dialogue as I saw fit, which I frequently did. I asked The Staffer what they thought about political collaboration in the Massachusetts Senate: do senators more frequently collaborate, or is division more common? Are their certain issues that are more likely evoke collaboration or division? How much does any present division slow down the process of legislation? How well do rural and urban legislators collaborate with each other?\nThe Staffer described the Senate as being a generally collaborative place, including between rural-representing and urban-representing senators, though with some caveats. The Staffer explained that neither rural vs urban nor democrat vs republican were the primary causes of division in the legislature. In fact, in the Staffer’s experience, rural and urban senators much more frequently worked together than they did against one another. The Staffer described most legislators as having an earnest willingness to collaborate with different groups of their colleagues, including across the rural-urban distinction. In The Staffer’s experience, productive, respectful and frequent communication between rural and urban senators was the norm.\nIn The Staffer’s perspective, the primary source of division in the Massachusetts legislature was between the two chambers: The House of Representatives and the Senate. According to the staffer, proceedings within each chamber were relatively harmonious in most ways, but the two chambers frequently disagreed and failed to collaborate with one another. The Staffer explained that this division was a significant impediment to progress, much more so than any division based on geography.\nThese results both confirm and add nuance to the results of the quantitative portion. Once again, collaboration is shown to be common between rural and urban legislators in MA, yet division still exists in some pockets of The General Court. Furthermore, this interview provides a real-time example of the harms of political division. The division between Massachusetts’ House of Representatives and Senate slows the pace of legislation, meaning important issues will go unaddressed for greater amounts of time, possibly with significant consequences for the people of Massachusetts.\n\n\nObservation of Legislative Sessions\nThe second component of the qualitative portion of this project was consisted of ethnographic observation of several formal sessions of legislation in the Massachusetts House of Representatives during the 193rd General Court (2023–2024). Ethnographic observation is the process of observing the behavior of research subjects (in this case, Massachusetts legislators) in their natural habitats (The Massachusetts House of Representatives). I observed representatives as they formally deliberated on bills by giving speeches that declared their reasons for supporting or opposing the relevant bill. During these speeches, representatives frequently referenced other representatives that had deliberated on the bill, referencing both their arguments, and more personal details. These sessions of observation provided rich detail into how elements of this political network actually interact, and the subjective nature of these interactions. These observations added color and detail to the broad patterns observed in the quantitative portion of the project.\nThe analysis of these observation sessions consisted of analyzing specific language, sentiments, and themes common to the representatives’ speeches. How did representatives speak to one another? Did they usually use more positive and supportive language, or negative and oppositional? Was there a difference in how representatives spoke to/about representatives from different setting types (rural vs urban) vs representatives from the same setting type? These were the kinds of questions which this component of the project was designed to answer.\nOverall, when representatives took the initiative to give formal speeches in support or opposition of a bill, the sentiments and language used were highly positive and collaborative, including when representatives were addressing/referencing a representative of the opposite setting type. Sentiments of cooperation were far more common than sentiments of opposition, and rural representatives frequently used language to support urban representatives, and vice versa. The bitter hostility that seems to embody contemporary Federal Politics in the US was noticeably absent.\nAnalysis of these observational sessions was done by breaking down the speeches into themes—sentiments, phrases, specific words, concepts, etc. that were common among the different speeches. Figure 3 shows the percentage of all thematic observation that each theme constituted. Thematically, support was the norm, even in inter-geographic-setting-type dynamics. General observations also supported the notion that representatives were more apt to collaborate with one another across all group distinctions (including geography) than they were to oppose one another. A suitable analogy would be a loving family gathering on thanksgiving: many different personalities from different walks of life converge, but the dynamic is generally positive and supportive, and though there may be some turbulence or conflict between certain members of the family, these conflicts are usually handled with respect and decorum.\nFigure 3:"

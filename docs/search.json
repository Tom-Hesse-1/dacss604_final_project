    "text": "Polarization, Division: The New American Norm?\n[Topic Sentence Here]. To even casual observers, polarization and division seem to characterize American politics. Bitter political cleavages have been formed along the lines of several factors: political ideologies (Source), age groups (Source), racial/ethnic identities (Source), and more. One divide stands out as particularly stark: geography. Rural and Urban politics are particularly polarized. Americans living in different types of geographic settings have opposing ideas on political issues (Source). Give examples polarization.\nParagraph about geographic polarization/division in general. Cite studies of issue in Italy, France.\nPolitical division has wide-reaching negative effects on both individuals and groups (Sources). Give examples of such negative effects. Predictions have been made that such polarization may deepen in coming years. This division and polarization is established and worrisome, but much of the research examines politics at the national level: what about politics at the state level? This project contributes to the investigation of this question.\n\n\nThis Project\nThis project examines the role of geographic division in Massachusetts state politics. Far less research has been dedicated to this topic than politics at the national level. However, state governments have significant power in the US. Therefore, it bears worth to examine how the important phenomenon of political division may be affecting governance at the state level. Each state has its own politics and issues, therefore it would be a monumental task to examine all states in one project. To approach the matter with appropriate depth, this project examines politics in one state only, The Bay State: The Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\nMassachusetts’ state government has a similar structure to the US federal government: An executive branch, responsible for the enforcement of laws, headed by a single executive (the governor) with numerous agencies; A bicameral legislative branch (having two distinct chambers) charged with the creation of new laws; and a judicial branch, composed of a system of courts that interpret the laws. This project investigates the question of geographic division in Massachusetts politics by examining the legislative branch specifically.\nThis project uses a mixed methods (utilizing both quantitative and qualitative methods) approach to study political cooperation in the Massachusetts legislature. The quantitative portion examines the Massachusetts House of Representatives, Massachusetts’ equivalent to the US’ House of Representatives. The House of Representatives consists of elected legislators that represent the different geographic districts of Massachusetts. The qualitative portion studies the other chamber of Massachusetts’ legislature, the Massachusetts Senate.\nThe quantitative portion of the project examines political cooperation in Massachusetts’ House of Representatives during 192nd General Court (the name of Massachusetts’ legislature). This legislative body was in session throughout 2021 and 2022. The primary method of investigation was network analysis of this body. Brief Primer on network theory/analysis. In this project, nodes represent individual representatives (legislators) in the 192nd General Court, and edges represent the cosponsoring of a bill. For example, if Representative A and Representative B both sponsor bill X, then there would be an edge between those two representatives. In this project, edges are weighted. If edges are weighted, it means that they have a value associated with them, representing some measurement. In this project, edge weight represents how many bills two nodes cosponsored. For instance, in the previous scenario, Representative A and Representative B cosponsored one bill, therefore the weight of the edge connecting them would be one. In another example, Representative B and Representative C sponsored three of the same bills, therefore the weight of the edge between them would be three. This analysis yielded multiple insights into the nature of political cooperation in the Massachusetts legislature. This will be expanded upon further in this project.\nThe qualitative portion of this project examines political cooperation in Massachusetts’ Senate during the 193rd General Court, which was in session throughout 2023 and 2024. The primary methods included in this portion of the project were an interview with a political insider—a senior member of a Massachusetts State Senator’s staff—and ethnographic observation of legislative sessions. This portion of the project focused on adding depth of understanding to the patterns observed in the quantitative portion. The interview and observation sessions gave deeper insight into what political cooperation in Massachusetts state politics looks like, and even why we see the patterns that we do.\n\n\nNetwork Analysis of Massachusetts House of Representatives, 2021–2022\n\n\nInterview and Observation of Massachusetts Senate, 2023–2024"

    "text": "[Topic Sentence Here]. To even casual observers, polarization and division seem to characterize American politics. Bitter political cleavages have been formed along the lines of several factors: political ideologies (Source), age groups (Source), racial/ethnic identities (Source), and more. One divide stands out as particularly stark: geography. Rural and Urban politics are particularly polarized. Americans living in different types of geographic settings have opposing ideas on political issues (Source). Give examples polarization.\nParagraph about geographic polarization/division in general. Cite studies of issue in Italy, France.\nPolitical division has wide-reaching negative effects on both individuals and groups (Sources). Give examples of such negative effects. Predictions have been made that such polarization may deepen in coming years. This division and polarization is established and worrisome, but much of the research examines politics at the national level: what about politics at the state level? This project contributes to the investigation of this question."

    "text": "Network Analysis of Massachusetts House of Representatives, 2021–2022\nThe quantitative portion of the project examines political cooperation in Massachusetts’ House of Representatives during the 192nd General Court (the name of Massachusetts’ legislature). This legislative body was in session throughout 2021 and 2022. The primary method of investigation was network analysis of this body. Brief Primer on network theory/analysis.\nIn this project, nodes represent individual representatives (legislators) in the 192nd General Court, and edges represent the cosponsoring of a bill. For example, if Representative A and Representative B both sponsor bill X, then there would be an edge between those two representatives. In this project, edges are weighted. If edges are weighted, it means that they have a value associated with them, representing some measurement. In this project, edge weight represents how many bills two nodes cosponsored. For instance, in the previous scenario, Representative A and Representative B cosponsored one bill, therefore the weight of the edge connecting them would be one. In another example, Representative B and Representative C sponsored three of the same bills, therefore the weight of the edge between them would be three. The data consisted of 87 nodes (individual representatives) and 50 bills that formed edges (connections) between those representatives. All bills were introduced during the 192nd General Court.\nThis analysis yielded multiple insights into the nature of political cooperation in the Massachusetts legislature. The graph below (Figure 1) shows the 10 nodes with the highest degree. In this case, a node’s degree is equal to the sum of the weights of all it’s different edges. For example, if Node A has 3 edges, all with weights of 2, then Node A has a degree of 6. Examining the nodes with the highest degrees is useful because it shows us which nodes are the most connected to other nodes in the network, i.e., which representatives are the most collaborative in this sample. Edges’ weights are denoted by their thickness: the thicker a connection between two nodes, the more bills those two nodes cosponsored together.\nWith the shape of the nodes representing geographic-setting-type (circle = rural district, square = urban district), we can see that the most collaborative representatives consist of a heterogeneous mix of urban-representing and rural-representing legislators. 6 of these nodes represent urban districts, 4 represent rural districts, and each of these nodes are heavily connected to one another. This paints a picture of rural- and urban-representing legislators collaborating by sponsoring the same bills, denoting a lack of division and polarization.\nFigure 1:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can learn more from this network. Another aspect of network theory, Block Modeling, can provide more insights about the nature of political collaboration in the Massachusetts legislature. Blockmodeling is a method used to simplify and study complex networks. It works by grouping nodes that have similar patterns of edges together, forming “blocks.” Therefore, nodes that are grouped together have similar roles within the networks. By analyzing which blocks different representatives are grouped into, we can learn about patterns of collaboration within this network.\nThe table below (Figure 2) shows a table that summarizes important information yielded by the blockmodeling analysis done for this project. In this case, the network was divided into 10 blocks. Each row in the table represents a distinct block. The different columns show how many rural-district-representing, urban-district-representing, Democrat, and Republican legislators are in each block. It also shows the ratios of rural:urban representatives and Democrat:Republican representatives in each group.\nFigure 2:\n\n\n\nBlockmodel Group Statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup\nRural\nUrban\nDemocrat\nRepublican\nRural:Urban_Ratio\nDemocrat:Republican_Ratio\n\n\n\n\n1\n5\n5\n4\n6\n1.00\n0.67\n\n\n2\n0\n12\n12\n0\n0.00\nInf\n\n\n3\n5\n2\n0\n7\n2.50\n0.00\n\n\n4\n11\n12\n21\n1\n0.92\n21.00\n\n\n5\n1\n3\n3\n1\n0.33\n3.00\n\n\n6\n1\n6\n7\n0\n0.17\nInf\n\n\n7\n1\n16\n17\n0\n0.06\nInf\n\n\n8\n2\n1\n3\n0\n2.00\nInf\n\n\n9\n1\n0\n1\n0\nInf\nInf\n\n\n10\n1\n2\n3\n0\n0.50\nInf\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that some groups show a diverse collection of rural and urban representatives (e.g. groups 1, 3, and 4), while others skew more heavily rural or urban (e.g. groups 2, 6, and 7). This shows that in some sections of the legislature, there is high collaboration between legislators representing different geographic types. In other factions, collaboration is more common between legislators that represent the same type of district. This adds nuance to our understanding of the network. We can see that there is certainly a significant level of collaboration between rural and urban representatives—confirming what Figure 1 shows us—but there are also portions of the legislature where such collaboration is less common.\nWhat does this tell us? It tells us that there was a moderate amount of rural-urban collaboration throughout Massachusetts 192nd House of Representatives, however it was concentrated in certain groups of legislators, while other groups displayed less inter-group collaboration. To make an analogy, picture a high-school cafeteria: some portion of the students are upperclassmen, the rest are lowerclassmen. A significant number of the tables in the cafeteria have both upperclassmen and lowerclassmen sitting at them, showing considerable mingling between the two groups. At the same time, there is also a significant number of tables that have mostly (or all) upperclassmen or lowerclassmen. In this cafeteria, inter-group mingling is common, but groups keeping to themselves is also common."

The primary methods included in this portion of the project were an interview with a political insider—a senior member of a Massachusetts State Senator’s staff—and ethnographic observation of legislative sessions. This portion of the project focused on adding depth of understanding to the patterns observed in the quantitative portion. The interview and observation sessions gave deeper insight into what political cooperation in Massachusetts state politics looks like, and even why we see the patterns that we do."
